moodle_ccaenrol_enrol
===================

ARCHIVED. This component was part of the old enrollment system, before we switched to using Moodle's native enrollment plugins. No longer in use.

Bare module component of CCA enrolment plugin

Accompanies `moodle_ccaenrol_cli` - this component registers the enrolment plugin with Moodle and provides ability to run via cron.

Must be installed *exactly* in `enrol/ccaroles` (preferably by build system).
